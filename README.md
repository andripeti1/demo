Functional Requirements: Requirement analysis is a software engineering approach that consists of a series of activities that establish the demands or conditions that must be satisfied for a new or updated product while taking into account the potential for competing requirements from different users. Functional requirements are those that are used to demonstrate the system's internal functioning nature, as well as the system's description and explanation of each subsystem. It comprises the task that the system should accomplish, the processes involved, the data that the system should contain, and the user interfaces.
The functional requirements discovered are as follows:
Customer registration – New users should be able to register online and be assigned a role as a simple user.
Car reservation online – Customers should be able to utilise the system to book and reserve automobiles online.
Automatic database update once a reservation is made or a new customer is registered – The system should be able to update the database without any further effort from the administrator whenever a new reservation or registration is made.

Non-functional Requirements: It describes system elements that are concerned with how the system fulfils functional requirements. They are as follows:
Security – Only authorised corporate workers may get access to the firm's secured page on the systems, and only users with proper passwords and usernames can log in to see the users page.
Performance and Response Time – The system should have a high-performance rate while executing user input and should be able to offer feedback or a response in a short amount of time.
Error handling – Errors should be avoided as much as possible, and a suitable error message should be supplied to help the user through the recovery process. Also Spring Boot Validators have been used in registration forms
Ease of use – The User Interface should be easy to use,
Assumptions:
At any one moment, each booking is connected with only one automobile reservation.
Cars that are part of the system should be available at a certain point.
